# bindings-codec2

<!--[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/relrod/bindings-codec2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/relrod/bindings-codec2)-->

Haskell FFI bindings to codec2.

NOTE: This is a very raw binding. It is probably best to create a nice, Haskell
library over this raw binding. I haven't started on this yet.
