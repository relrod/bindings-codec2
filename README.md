# bindings-codec2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/relrod/bindings-codec2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/relrod/bindings-codec2)

Haskell FFI bindings to codec2.

## Note 1

This is a very raw binding. It is probably best to create a nice, Haskell
library over this raw binding. I haven't started on this yet.

## Note 2

This is built against the latest rpm on
[files.freedv.org](http://files.freedv.org/fedora/release/20/x86_64/). This is
out of sync with HEAD of codec2, and therefore is missing some functions.

## License

GPLv2+ (same as codec2 itself).
